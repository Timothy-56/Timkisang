# String Processor

## Overview
The String Processor program is a Python application designed to process a list of strings provided by the user. It identifies the starting and ending digits of strings, offers an option to reverse the resulting list of digits, and allows users to explore various outputs interactively.

## Features
1. **Digit Extraction**:
   - Finds the starting and ending digits of strings where both the first and last characters are digits.
2. **List Reversal**:
   - Gives the option to reverse the list of extracted starting and ending digits.
3. **Interactive Options**:
   - Allows users to choose between displaying the original list, the reversed list, or ending the program.
4. **User-Friendly Input**:
   - Prompts users to enter their own list of strings and includes an option to finish input.

## How to Use
1. **Run the Program**:
   - Save the script as `string_processor.py`.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the program using Python:
     ```bash
     python string_processor.py
     ```

2. **Enter Strings**:
   - The program will ask you to input strings one by one. 
   - Type `done` when you're finished entering strings.

3. **Process Strings**:
   - The program will extract the starting and ending digits from strings where both are numeric.
   - You will be prompted to decide whether to reverse the extracted list.

4. **Interactive Options**:
   - Choose between:
     - Displaying the **original list** of digits.
     - Displaying the **reversed list** of digits.
     - Ending the program.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The program will display the final processed list of digits before ending.

## Example
### Input:
```plaintext
Enter a string (or type 'done' to finish): 123abc4
Enter a string (or type 'done' to finish): 5xyz6
Enter a string (or type 'done' to finish): abcde
Enter a string (or type 'done' to finish): done
